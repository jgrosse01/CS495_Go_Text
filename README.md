# CS495_Go_Text
A simple console based quote generator written in Go for the Carroll College Computer Science Seminar Class.

This program simply reads and pulls random quotes from a file of quotes. This file can added to manually, just ensure that each new quote is on exactly one new line and that there are NO GAPS between quotes.

This is my first experience with Go or any similar language and as such this has been a fun adventure, though challenging.

To run this program you will need a version of Go installed on your system. This project was made with Go Version 1.17 and runs with installed versions 1.17 and 1.18. It is necessary to download a version of Go because we were specifically instructed to not include the built executables in this project repository.
To install Go, visit this link and follow the instructions which correspond to your operating system: https://go.dev/doc/install (newer versions of Go are not guaranteed to work to run this project. If the latest version of Go does not work, you will need to find a way to install one of the two tested versions mentioned).

Once you have successfully installed a Go version capable of running this program, run the program by simply cloning the repository, opening a command line/terminal, navigating to the root directory of the cloned project, and typing the command "go run main.go" without the quotes included.

If there are errors, ensure that the "main.go" can be executed by your permission group. If it still produces errors, elevate the permissions of your command prompt for windows users and elevate the permission of your command for Mac/Linux users.
